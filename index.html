      <p id="para">Hannah Tooktoo is a young Inuk artist from Kuujjuaq, QC. Hannah is a graduate of Nunavik Sivunitsavut, and is currently enrolled in the Visual Arts program in Dawson College. She has been affected by the suicide epidemic in her region and recognizes the need for more attention, services and support in our Inuit and Indigenous communities. She has written a poem which addresses the heavy subject. The poem is called Suicide and is posted on her page. She plans to bike across Canada to raise awareness of the suicide epidemic in Inuit and Indigenous communities. The trip will start in Victoria, BC on June 16th. She chose to start her journey in the mountains because she believes that in order to reach smoother roads, one must work hard in the beginning. <br><br>Her main message she wants to spread is Anirnimi Kipisina - Do not cut your life short. Hannah will be posting her journey throughout her trip, posting updates on her page of her challenges and progress. She also plans to pass through Indigenous communities to exchange experiences of how suicide has affected them as well as brainstorm on ways towards healing. She is raising money through her page and GoFundMe Hannahâ€™s Journey Across Canada. Her goal is to reach 25000$ in order to make her trip possible, and donate to an organization in her region that is fighting for Inuit's mental health and suicide prevention.<br>
